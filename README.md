# JAGE

![](cool.png)

(J)ust (A)nother (G)ame (E)ngine. Highly unoptimized, written by an imbecile. This exists because I want to learn about 3D graphics.
 
## Features

You compile the code and suddenly and you can move around a beautiful 3D rendered backpack. Check `Engine.cpp` for how things are created and manipulated, should be very straight forward.

# End Goals

- FPS game, move around, shoot things;
